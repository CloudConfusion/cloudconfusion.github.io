#A Free Powershell Repository with CI CD
###...and I do most of the work for you (Part 1 of 2 - the Nuget Server)


That sounds like an emmy award winning blog right there !

My main reason for writing this blog, much like a lot of people’s is:

~~I really want Microsoft to give me an MVP~~    
Love.
 
 Okay it’s more it was way more hassle than I expected for some bits of it so thought I’d write it down in case I forget about it.  Plus it’s a chance to automate some stuff. 
 
 Big thanks to both Microsofts doc and Kevin Mar blog who gave me the leg up to get started.  
 I’m not going to go into why you might want your own repository rather than just stuffing your files into one big sock under your bed, this is just the technical part of getting it together.
 
 
###What you get in this post
	- Instructions and scripts on how to setup a free Nuget server in an Azure WebApp with a CICD pipeline in Azure Devops (formally VSTS)


###What you don’t get in this post (links tho!)
	- Why you want a repo
	- How to setup an Azure account
	- How to setup an Azure Devops account 
	- How to add your new repo (part 2)

###Requirements:
	- Azure subscription (Free)
	- Azure Devops (Free)
