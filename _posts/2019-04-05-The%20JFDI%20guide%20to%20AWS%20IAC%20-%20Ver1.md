## Welcome to the first in the JFDI series!

 There is a LOT of info out there about best practices, which tools are good, which tools are garbage and the absolute best way to do everything.  
 This blog series is about something different. It’s about just getting on with it and starting to try things.  
 It’s about trying something with the minimum of fuss without painting yourself into a corner. 
 At the end of the post will be the "DO MORE!” section that will have ways you can build on the skeleton framework that’s got it started to take it beyond V1 
 It will lay out the skeleton and first iteration of a production ready framework.  It won’t be "how to be the best", it’s "how to get past decision paralysis and just start learning"
JFDI means Just Do It without Fuss.  What’s that ? Those letters don’t line up? 
My bad.. 
 

##Agenda 

 We’re going to get you the means to get started using Cloudformation to deploy Infrastructure as Code and build up a VM (ec2)  with an attached Firewall (security group).  In the real world you’d grow this to add it into a VPC , Subnet and so on but this is a JFDI post. It’s not what it’s about. It’s about wetting your whistle. 
 Minimum of fuss.   
 We’re going to get your code writing local environment set up decently though, so that it’s easy to continue to go further. Little bit beyond minimum, but worth it. 
 
####Requirements  (I’ll explain some of these more)
 
- [AWS account - free tier is all fine](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://cloudconfusionsa.blob.core.windows.net/blogimages/Jekyll/JFDI/aws.iac/IMG_0647.JPG)
- Cloudformation plugin by aws-scripting-guy
- vscode-cfn-lint plugin by XXXXXXX
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- cfn-lint (from PiP)   
  
####Out of Scope explanations: 
- **IAC - Infrastructure as Code**  I’m not going to go over the benefits of this.   JFDI!

- **Source Control / Git**  I’m not going to go over the benefits of this or even mention it much in this post. That being said, JFDI.  It’s not that hard to get a one person flow going. 



###Let’s FDI !

At a high level here’s what we’re going to do

- Install a plugin that both helps format YAML and offers snippers for Cloudformation Resources

- Install a plugin that "lints" your Cloudformation template and tells you whether your template is hot garbage or whizzbang good. The only two standards worth using.  ISO has nothing on them.  This one’s got a few more steps.  

- Once they’re in. We’re going to write a template. Save it. Open the AWS console and tell it to use it to build some dope infrastructure. Dope is a word the kids use to mean good, not silly as you might expect. 


Round 1 - FIGHT!

Get an AWS account signed into,  Download Visual Studio Code, Install Python.  
There’s links from the requirements section. Why you even here if you’ve not done the requirements? 

Make sure Python is on your PATH too ideally.  So if you type “python"" in bash, or powershell it knows what it is. 
If you’re using a different shell you probably know enough to fix errors like it not being on the path. 
If stuck, type words into google.

Round 2 - FIGHT! 

Open Admin Powershell / Bash whatever. You can even go to the python REPL I believe and do it there if you failed to get it on the path.   

type "pip install cfn-lint"

This is a Cloudformation python based linter provided by AWS. It can be run against templates from the cmdline.
Luckily, someone made a VScode plugin that runs it against your template in VScode and that makes it a lot easier.

  Once that’s in and successful. Open up VScode and install the following two extensions.
  Take note, the linter extension is just using that python program you installed in the background.
  So if you didn’t do that, it won’t work.

 Okay, we are ready to go !
 
 Round 3 - FIGHT!
 
 
 Hope you’re ready for a lot of pictures. Maybe a Gif. Who knows. Am feelin’ saucy. 
 
 
 First thing to do is create a new yaml document.
