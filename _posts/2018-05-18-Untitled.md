 # Who did you speak to?
 
 It is without a doubt my least favourite  smartphone I’ve owned. 
 It’s not a terrible phone but it is a terrible Android flagship phone and my least favourite Samsung.
 I’ve had the S, S3,S5, S7 edge.  
 
 Here’s the top 3 offenders.
   
 1. The stupid thin bar shape
 The official reason for this is because content is consumed vertically on a smartphone. 
 V true, however, you only really look at the middle section and then scroll.  You might be different but I’ve yet to see anyone who starts at the top, gets to the bottom and then scrolls.  
 If you *are* one of those people were you sitting there going:
 "I sure do get tired of having to scroll so often. What I really want to do is move my eyes up and down a further distance".  Tired eyes, free with the S9 
 
 Know what else people do vertically on their smartphones? Type! 
 
 Know what’s harder to do with a thinner phone? Type!
 
 What about another freebie ?  some sweet black bars when you turn the phone sideways to watch stuff full screen because no one makes stupidly shaped content ..yet.
 Do you like watching Twitch vertical mode so you can join in harassing a lady doing no harm to anyone ? 
 well you still get a smaller video because it’s a thin stupid shape. 
 
   
  2.  The curved edges of the Screen
  Useless.  Just makes the phone harder to grip. The edge bar is junk that I just turn off since I could find no real good use for it and it just got activated accidentally sometimes.  It does nicely fuck up having to press some things in corners and edges though. 
  (the screen quality itself is fantastic though)
  
  3.  The Fingerprint Reader / Button removal
  Nice work folks, we got the whole front pretty much a screen. Let’s stick the fingerprint reader where they can put their mucky paws all over the camera lens and put some really crap haptic feedback down the bottom. 
  It’s not ideal but it’s the cost you pay to have a crap typing experience and full screen viewing. 
  
  
  Not all these things are exclusive to Samsung in industry terms but I’m having none of it until I must.  
  New phone time.
