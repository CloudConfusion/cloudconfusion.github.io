##### Diary of a Loud Mouthed Braggart from The Future

I mess around with a lot of stuff to try it out and then forget what I was doing. 
Some of it is because perhaps all the links I found to other people's blogs maybe were out of date now and then maybe I wanted to do extra stuff over and above so thought "I'll add on 10% value and pretend I did it ALL. 

I'm mostly a Microsoft punter. Winops or whatever.
